this is how you comment in ruby, using begin and end,
you can also use a hash tag for shorter comments
for this little project you are going to start a vocab list
where you are going to set all the vocab equal to variables of the same name.

=end
vocab=Hash.new
vocab["pred"] = "this makes a integer go down one, you use it like 5.pred would be 4"#this is a comment
vocab["variable"] = "A variable is the name that you assign to a piece of information"
vocab["next"]="increases an integer by 1"
vocab["strings"]="Any length of numbers or letters within quotes"
vocab["comments"]="Part of the code that is only read by humans, started with =begin and ends with =end"
vocab["terminal"]="An application that you can run coding in"
vocab["operators"]="An operator is anything that causes an action in coding. here is a list of operators and their actions

+ adds

vocab["booleans"]="A boolean value is true or false"
vocab["reverse"]="Reverses the code string"
vocab["length"]="counts the characters in a strings"
vocab["upcase"]="Makes the string uppercase"
